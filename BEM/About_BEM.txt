BEM stands for Block Element Identifier
    It helps you write HTML & CSS that are more easily perceivable and reusable.

    By following this convention helps you a lot of time on your projects and avoids the creation of big CSS mess.

    This is also a great choice when working with team

To follow BEM convention we have to split the contents of a page into blocks.

    A Block can be a button, header, footer or whatever.

    Inside the block we have elements.
        For example if it is a footer then inside the block we have title, paragraph, logo/icons and so, these are called elements

    Since we want stuff to be reusable we have modifiers
        Suppose if two elements have same pattern then we can modify one of them with different color, style and so.

Naming convention of these levels should be:

block
block__element
block__element--modifier
